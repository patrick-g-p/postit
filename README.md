A Reddit clone I built as a bootcamp student at [Tealeaf Academy](https://gotealeaf.com) (which has rebranded as [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/))

It makes use of Ruby 2.2 and Rails 4.

You can find the project [hosted on Heroku](https://lit-cove-6280.herokuapp.com/).

I plan on revisiting this project during the summer of 2018 and updating it to Rails 5. It'll still use the old reddit UI, as the new one leave a lot to be desired.
